# DSP Lab Project: Ensuring Anonymity

Authors: Tolga Dimlioglu, Seyda Guzelhan

Our project's name is Ensuring Anonymity. As the name implies, the main motivation behind the program that is implemented for this project is to protect the identity of the user who uses the program to confess something, reveal information or testify. This is achieved with the manipulation of the user's voice by adding variety of sound effects and background noise. In total, there are 4 different options for both sound effects and background noise and, users can choose among them according to their preferences. Besides, user's speech is processed by IBM Watson's Speech-to-Text (S2T) Recognition module for transcription. Transcribed texts are displayed to the user in real-time and, the user can pause the recording which also pauses the transcription feature. During the pause, user can make some edits on the transcribed text to fix some potential errors produced by the S2T module.
